## What is the Cartesian Product of the sname field from Species
## with the tname field from Tank?
## projects both species and tank names then displays the cartesian product between them

q3r3 = project (species) (sname)
q3r4 = project (tank) (tname)
q3r5 = (q3r3) product (q3r4)

display ( q3r5 )
